## Description

This was a homework assignment where the challenge was to create the backend of a workout tracking application that relied on MongoDB (NoSQL). The application allows users to view, create, and track daily workouts. They can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and they are also to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of resistance exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they are able to track the distance traveled.

**Please Note:** The front-end code was provided, and the dashboard utilized [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
